# Tic-Tac-Toe
#### A project by Pauline Hocher, Jonas Herrmann, Marcel Karas, Simeon Schwarzkopf and Alexander Zank realized at Hohenstaufen-Gymnasium Bad Wimpfen during December 2018.

## Introduduction
The goal of project Mega-Tic-Tac-Toe is the implementation of a mechanical player for a bigger sized "Connect 4" board. Programatically this is achieved by using an Arduino Genuino Uno and the code contained in this repository.

## Construction outline
A stepper motor-powered hinge allows the tile magazine to be moved around freely on top of the "Connect-4" board while the magazine's opening and reloading mechanism is realized by using a small servo. An LED strip on the bottom has been added for aesthetical reasons.
